drinking

for me
it was or
is
a manner of
dying
with boots on
and gun
smoking and a 
symphony music
background.

drinking alone,
I mean.
that's the only
drinking...
drinking alone
being alone
fitting the parts
feeling the parts.

of course
drinking can
kill
you

a cold shower
can
or a painting by
Gaugin
or an old dog
on a hot
day.

I would have to suppose
that one thousand swallows
crossing your marble
overhead
sky
at once
could do
it.

that's why I
drink: waiting for
something like
that.
